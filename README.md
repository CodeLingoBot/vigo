ViGo - Vi in Go
===============

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/kisielk/vigo/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/kisielk/vigo/latest)

ViGo is an attempt to implement a vim-like text editor in Go, while maintaining a lean feature set. 
The project is still in its early days and definitely not suitable for daily use yet.

It's based on nsf's religious [godit](https://github.com/nsf/godit)
